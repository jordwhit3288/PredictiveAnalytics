```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(VIM)
library(mice)

```

```{r}
grades <- read_csv("class-grades.csv")
summary(grades)
str(grades)
```

Task 1: There are a total of 11 NA's in the dataset. These NA's exist in Tutorial, Midterm, TakeHome, and Final.


```{r}
vim_plot = aggr(grades, numbers = TRUE, prop=c(TRUE, FALSE), cex.axis=.7)

```
Task 2: The above VIM plot shows that there is not systematic missingness.  There is only one occurance of a student missing multiple pieces of data. In that instance, the two missing pieces of data are from the midterm and the takehome variables. The proportion of missingness is quite low as well with the highest proportion being .004


```{r}

row_wise_grades <- grades %>%
  drop_na(Tutorial, Midterm, TakeHome, Final)

```
Task 3: After removing NA's using row-wise deletion, there are now 89 observations in the newly created dataframe, row_wise_grades.


```{r}

column_wise_grades <- grades %>%
  select(-Tutorial, -Midterm, -TakeHome, -Final)

```

Task 4: After nuking the columns that had NA values, once the fallout cleared, only two variables were left standing.  Those are Prefix and Assignment.

Task 5: When comparing the implementation of row-wise deletion versus column-wise deletion, for this specific dataset, my opinion is that row-wise deletion is the best way to manage missingness. The dataframe did not have copious amounts of variables that would make up for the removal of column-wise deletion.  


```{r}
grades_imp = mice(grades, m=1, method = "pmm", seed = 12345)
#in line above: m=1 -> runs one imputation, seed sets the random number seed to get repeatable results
summary(grades_imp)
densityplot(grades_imp)
#red imputed, blue original, only shows density plots when more than 1 value the variable was imputed
#note that the density plots are fairly uninteresting given the small amount of missing data
grades_complete = complete(grades_imp)
summary(grades_complete)




```

Task 7: Dealing with missing data is common and typically requires the deployment of multiple approaches to determine an appropriate solution.  Issues that can occur when dealing with missing data is that the data scientist may inject data that will further prove their hypothesis.  This bias could lead to a misrepresentation of the data.  Although, there are some more objective ways to manage missing data, a technique that comes to mind is using KNN (K Nearest Neighbors), to measure some distance and their average to impute the missing data.
